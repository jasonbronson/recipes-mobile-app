## Cooking — Personal Recipe Manager

A mobile app for saving and organizing recipes. Paste a link or text and the app uses AI to extract ingredients, steps, times, and other details into clean, structured recipes you can keep on your device.

### Key Features
- **AI-powered extraction**: Add recipes by URL or pasted text; details are parsed automatically.
- **Share Extension**: Save directly from Safari and other apps via Share → Cooking.
- **Clean structure**: Ingredients, instructions, timings, yields, and metadata stored in a consistent format.
- **Fast search**: Find recipes by name, ingredient, or source.
- **Favorites and organization**: Star favorites and keep your collection tidy.
- **Works offline**: Access saved recipes without a connection.

### How It Works
1. **Add a recipe** via the Share Extension from Safari or other apps, or paste a URL/raw text inside the app.
2. **AI extracts** key fields (title, ingredients, steps, times, yields, images, source).
3. **Normalize and save**: The app stores the structured result in local storage for quick, offline access.

### Usage
- Use the iOS Share Extension: in Safari or any app, tap Share → Cooking to import the URL.
- Or, open the app to paste a URL or raw page text, then Save.
- Review and edit any field before saving.
- Use search to quickly filter by keyword or ingredient.

### Privacy
- Your saved recipes are stored on your device.
- Only the data necessary for extraction is sent to the AI service.
